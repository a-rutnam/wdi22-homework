      <h2>A pioneering computer programmer</h2>
      <p>
     Born in New York City in 1906, Grace Hopper joined the U.S. Navy during World War II and was assigned to program the Mark I computer. She continued to work in computing after the war, leading the team that created the first computer language compiler, which led to the popular COBOL language. Among her many accomplishments, Grace is known for having pioneered the idea that a programming language could be developed using entirely English words rather than manipulating symbols. <a href="#">Read More...</a></p>

<h2>Writing on Grace</h2>
<p>
Grace became so frustrated with trying to grasp these units that she made a call to some engineers and asked them to send her a nanosecond… the engineers took her seriously. Or at least they come up with a more or less serious way of answering her. The sent her a piece of wire that was 11.78 inches long. This piece of wire represented how far electricity could go through the wire in the amount of a nanosecond.
<br><br>
Grace was delighted. Next she asked for a piece of wire that would represent the length of a microsecond… this piece of wire was an entire coil that was 984 feet long!
<br><br>
Grace explained in <em>Grace Hopper&#58; Navy Admiral and Computer Pioneer</em>, “Sometimes I think we should hand a [984 foot coil of wire] on all programmers’ desks… so they know exactly what they are throwing away when they throw away a microsecond.”
